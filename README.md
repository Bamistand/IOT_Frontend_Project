# Retrofitting Old Analog Appliances to Smart Ones 

This project aims to promote energy efficiency by retrofitting old analog appliances with smart plugs. By doing so, we aim to reduce wasteful energy consumption and make it easier for users to monitor and control their energy use.

It provides a web dashboard for users to interact with the appliances/devices and control their retrofitted analog appliances. It aslo provides an Admin(Sales Officer) dashboard to register users, devices, assign them as well, graph summary of users.
